\begin{section}{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{sec:conclusion}
Write the conclusion as soon as rest of paper is done and experimental results begin coming in. Give a quick paragraph or 2 summary of what happened, what I learned, and what didn't go as expected.

List any future work that may be included next. Off the top of my head right now we could include adaptive motion planning using optimization with a cost function, unknown obstacles, non-static obstacles, an alternate adaptive control scheme, UAV system dynamics, and an adaptive motion planner that's able to venture away from the desired trajectory to maximize performance.
