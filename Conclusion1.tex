Write the conclusion as soon as rest of paper is done and experimental results begin coming in. Give a quick paragraph or 2 summary of what happened, what I learned, and what didn't go as expected.

List any future work that may be included next. Off the top of my head right now we could include adaptive motion planning using optimization with a cost function, unknown obstacles, non-static obstacles, an alternate adaptive control scheme, UAV system dynamics, and an adaptive motion planner that's able to venture away from the desired trajectory to maximize performance.

% To Do List:

% 	\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1\parindent]
% 	\item Implementing PID controller for comparison (Doing this right now).
% 	\item Increase size of titles, axis, legend fonts in all figures
% 	\item A figure for the Introduction to make paper more appealing.
% 	\item Finalize equation for Problem 1 in problem statement.
% 	\item In figure 1, Fix "position" to "state" estimation.
% 	\item $\hat{\bm{x}}$ as output of state estimation in Figure 1.
% 	\item Goal points should be lettered instead of saying "Goal $1$"
% 	\item Another implementation of what would happen if detector is not running.
% 	\item Change Figure 1 and 2 to include AC after the detector
% 	\item add math and explanation of averaging N number of past inputs (or outputs) allows us to see ramp spoofs within the noise.
% 	\item lemma(s)
	
% 	\end{enumerate}
