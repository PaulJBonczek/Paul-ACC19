Today's autonomous vehicles are fitted with numerous on-board sensors and computers that make them suitable for many civilian and military applications. Many complex capabilities like autonomous navigation, surveillance, mapping, and manipulations have transformed the uses of vehicles to improve our daily lives. 
%These new complex capabilities have transformed the uses of vehicles to improve our daily lives. 
With these new enhancements and capabilities, comes the risk of more security vulnerabilities to attacks and failures. An adversary has the opportunity of performing malicious attacks on sensor systems to degrade performance or completely lead the vehicle to an undesired state. For example, a vehicle could be hijacked into an undesired region by spoofing its on-board GPS as demonstrated in \cite{lee}.

Several different solutions have been presented to address sensor attacks, from sensor redundancy to complex filtering techniques \cite{fawzi2014secure,pasqualetti2013attack,6120187,6943080,7330811}. However, a solution for detecting malicious attacks on a system with an unknown model due to changes in dynamics or disturbances has yet to be proposed. This paper introduces a technique to detect sensor attacks on a dynamically changing system without losing control performance. We leverage an adaptive control algorithm to detect sensor under attacks and present an innovative adaptive planning framework to guarantee safety while the vehicle is navigating in an uncertain environment with changes in dynamics (e.g., due to a failure), disturbances (e.g., changes in surface material) and system's configuration (e.g., one or more sensors are removed after detecting that they are compromised).

Our goal is to distinguish between malicious sensor attacks and dynamical changes or disturbances to the system. Once an attack is detected the system is operating without one or more sensors, hence the system is not able to perform as originally designed. Thus, the vehicle mission needs to be adapted: its motion performance needs  to be updated depending on the availability of the uncompromised sensors and their noise profiles. Adapting its motion ensures that the vehicle will not enter undesired states. \NB{maybe add an example and a figure with everything}

The contribution of this paper comes in two parts: 1) we design a technique that is able to detect sensor attacks on an unknown, dynamically changing system, 2) after the compromised sensors have been removed, we propose a motion replanning technique to guarantee autonomous vehicle safety (i.e., something bad will never happen) and liveness (i.e., something good will eventually happen) while navigating in an obstacle filled environment using limited sensors of varying noise profiles. 
To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that consider control and planning adaptation in the context of cyber-physical systems (CPS) cybersecurity.

\subsection{Related Work}
\label{sec:Related Work}

\NB{skipping this section for now}The study of both security and safety of autonomous vehicles has gained a lot of popularity among the robotics community due to their potential military and civilian applications. Various problems researchers have been interested in solving are detection of malicious attacks and guaranteeing vehicle safety when uncertainties are present. Attackers could deliberately attempt to compromise the vehicle's integrity, control performance, and safety. As demonstrated in \cite{lee} the ability to spoof GPS sensors to drive a yacht off course. That work shows attackers with malicious intent would be able to drive a vehicle to an undesired location. Numerous control and model based techniques have been recently leveraged to prevent such future events from happening. For example, in \cite{6426811}, leverages state feedback by changing system dynamics via pole placement. In \cite{zhu2012resilient}, a receding-horizon control algorithm is used to defend against replay attacks. Attack detection using a known linear system model is presented in \cite{pasqualetti2013attack}. Sensor redundancy based on a linear system models are presented in \cite{fawzi2014secure,6943080,7330811}. All of these works presented assume a static system model over time, where dynamics aren't changing due to degradation, damage, and environmental or external factors.

When uncertainties arise or changes in the system have occurred, the vehicle needs to alter its plan of motion. Work in reachability analysis \cite{8046382,7799325,5980268} leverages the system model and uncertainties to determine inputs avoid potential obstacles. In \cite{5980508}, creating Random-Belief Trees guarantees safety in uncertain environments for safe navigation. \cite{6934041} calculates a Risky Area with the help of probability density functions to prevent vehicle collisions.

% \NB{first literature on cyber-security of CPS under sensor attacks, then mention that we are using AC and list relevant literature on AC here. Finally mention that we are proposing a replanning approach and list some previous work on this topic}

In this work, we build a framework to which we are able to detect malicious sensor attacks on a dynamically changing system to protect integrity of control and safety. To accomplish this goal, we use an adaptive control algorithm to ensure control performance is not degraded while the system is changing. More uncertainties arise with an unknown system, so we want to be able to differentiate between sensor attacks and dynamical changes or faults in the system. From \cite{tao2003adaptive,Goodwin:2009:AFP:1643720}, a  discrete-time adaptive control approach is utilized to help us achieve these control objectives.

In this work, which is different from related work, we are able to detect sensor attacks on systems experiencing changing dynamics. With these changing dynamics, we are still able to maintain control performance.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section \ref{sec:problem}, we formally define the problems at hand and Section \ref{sec:modeling}, we define all system, noise, and disturbance models. Section \ref{sec:approach}, we discuss the approach taken to attack detection and navigational safety and then validation with simulation and experiments in Section \ref{sec:simulation}. Lastly, we draw conclusions and discuss future work in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.
