To validate the previous background, equations, methodology, simulations, an experiment of the proposed adaptive system under sensor spoofing needs to be shown. A series of experiments showing the ground vehicle translating effectively around a varying environment and can effectively spot a sensor being spoofed. The experiments will be implemented on a Jackal robot.
