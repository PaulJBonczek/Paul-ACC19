Modern autonomous vehicles rely on their on-board sensors to effectively control and navigate safely through uncertain environments. When attackers maliciously compromise these vital sensors, the vehicle's performance is inhibited which can potentially direct the vehicle to an undesired state. In this paper we focus on two main problems: i) how to detect sensor attacks when the vehicle's dynamics are unknown or changing, while still maintaining control performance and ii) guaranteeing vehicle navigation safety when the attacked sensor is removed and now relying on sensor(s) of different uncertainty by adapting its motion. To accomplish this, we propose a control architecture utilizing an adaptive controller capable of detecting sensor attacks and an estimation technique to ensure confidence in vehicle safety. Finally, we validate the proposed approach with simulations and experiments where at ground vehicle is given a trajectory to reach a goal while experiencing sensor attacks and dynamical changes.
