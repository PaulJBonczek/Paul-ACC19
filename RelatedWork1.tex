\section{Related Work} \label{sec:Related Work}

Should this be a subsection within the Introduction? Similar work in this area. Robotics, Adaptive Control, Security, Estimation, Motion Planning, Localization. SHould contain 15-20 references in here. Compare what other papers have to what I'm proposing in this paper. Maybe paper "x" didn't consider this or that, but in this paper we considered this or that. To show an improvement in the work. 

Mention Nicola's previous work (maybe 2-3 different papers). Towards the end of the related work, or this could be in the intro? just include a brief organization of the paper describing which sections the material is located (approach, results, etc.).
