1) Build off of the introduction

2) Talk about previous work in this area. This will include the various techniques used for detection. (Redundancy, filtering, modeling). Then talk about different techniques used for safety in navigating. (Filtering, motion planning, reachability, etc). Should contain 15-20 references in here. 

3) Discuss what other papers don't have compared to what I'm proposing in this paper. Maybe paper "x" didn't consider this or that, but in this paper we considered this or that. For example, to show an improvement in the work, we consider paper "x"'s results but changes them in such a way for improvement. (These papers all consider LTI systems, mine is proposing a solution to unknown changes in the A and B matrices in the model). Introduce the confidence interval estimation. Compare it to other algorithms that have safety guarantees for navigating. Talk about how my work has guarantees (then show later in the approach).

4) Include a brief organization of the paper describing which sections the material is located (approach, results, etc. ...)
