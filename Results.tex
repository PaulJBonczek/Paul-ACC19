The case study for this paper is with a ground vehicle experiencing the effects of sensor and process noise, while also succumbing to wind disturbances. The vehicle will be traveling along a preplanned desired trajectory with assumed to be known obstacles nearby. While the vehicle is traveling, the model will be experiencing dynamical changes due to a changing environment while also having its sensors compromised. (Show a figure, or more, of the vehicle within the environment showing the path and obstacles). The continuous time model for velocity is represented with parameters for damping forces $\bm{b}$ and vehicle mass $\bm{m}$:
\begin{equation}
\bm{\dot{x}}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\
  0 & -\frac{b}{m} \end{bmatrix}x(t) + \begin{bmatrix} 0  \\  \frac{1}{m} \end{bmatrix}u(t)
\end{equation}
