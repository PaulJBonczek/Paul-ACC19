\label{sec:problem}

In this work we consider autonomous vehicle operations in cluttered environments under different uncertainties including noise, failures, and cyber-attacks on its sensors. 
We are interested in finding a strategy to detect sensor attacks in an unknown, dynamically changing system and guarantee that the vehicle is always able to navigate safely in the environment. A ground vehicle has an objective to navigate to one or more goal $g_i$ where $i=1,2,\dots,N_g$ at the positions $\bm{p}_{g_i} \in \bm{P}_g =  \begin{bmatrix} \bm{p}_{g_1},\bm{p}_{g_2},\dots,\bm{p}_{g_{N_g}} \end{bmatrix}$, while guaranteeing safety among uncertainties within an environment, failures, system aging, noise, and possible cyber-attacks


% True state of system and estimate is within the noise of the system x-x_hat < some norm
% be able to distinguish between dynamical changes and attacks and also adapt the motion planning to safety travel in the environment


% 1st section of adaptive control (approach) talk more about detection
% What kind of attacks can I detect?

% Lemmas to show something


\begin{problem} 
\label{problem1} {\textbf{Detection and Sensor Reconfiguration:}} 
The objective is to be able to detect sensor attacks within a dynamically unknown system and then removing any compromised sensor to maintain proper control of the vehicle. Given the system dynamics as a function of its state $ \bm{x} $, its input $ \bm{u}$, and disturbances $ \bm{d} $,
	\begin{equation}
		\bm{x}(k+1) = f(\bm{x}(k), \bm{u}(k), \bm{d}(k))
	\end{equation}
we want to find a policy $\mathcal{P}$ at time instant $k$ that:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item can differentiate between a malicious sensor attack and changing dynamics or failures. 
	\item remove the compromised sensor to restore system integrity for all future time instances $k+h$. 
\end{enumerate}
Solving this problem will allow the autonomous vehicle to safely navigate during system and environmental dynamical changes while preventing an attacker from having an undesirable effect on the system. \NB{rephrase}
\end{problem}
	
\begin{problem} \label{problem2} {\textbf{Adaptive Motion:}} 
Sensor and dynamical uncertainties lead to errors in estimation, this results in an increased risk of navigating into an undesired region. To guarantee vehicle safety, it must be able to avoid any undesired areas (e.g., obstacles, cliffs) when these uncertainties exist.
	\begin{equation}
		\lVert {\bm{p}(k)-\bm{p}_{r_i}} \rVert >\Delta(k),  i \in \begin{bmatrix} 1,N_r \end{bmatrix}
	\end{equation}
where $\bm{p}(k)={\begin{bmatrix} x,y \end{bmatrix}}^T$ is the position of the vehicle, $\bm{p}_{r_i}$ is the positions of the ${i}^{th}$ regions to avoid in the $x-y$ plane, $\Delta$ is a defined distance between the outer most point of the estimation confidence interval and an undesired region, and $N_r$ is the total number of undesired regions. As a compromised sensor is removed, sensor reconfiguration changes the uncertainty due to sensor noise. Adapting to these changing uncertainties enables the vehicle to be resilient to its alterations.

%A ground vehicle's mission is to safely follow a desired trajectory within an obstacle filled environment. The system will possess a higher estimation uncertainty when less desirable sensors are being used for navigation. All obstacle positions are known beforehand, which makes off-line trajectory planning suitable. We want to find a policy that will guarantee the safety of the vehicle under changing noise levels, such that a vehicle will not collide with any obstacles.

%To guarantee safety from uncertainties and disturbances, a confidence interval approach will be used to estimate the system's position to ensure safe passage through an environment. The system will be able to move freely without constraints at a position far from obstacles, but will have altered capabilities as soon as obstacles come within reach.
